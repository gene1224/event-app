## Event APP

    composer install
    npm install
    php artisan migrate
    
For database I used the latest MySQL version which is 8.
For PHP version is 7.4

This app is built using Vue, but I used inertia.js to jumpstart the setup of VueJS
For database connection I just used very simple setup

    DB_DATABASE=db_name
    DB_USERNAME=db_user_sample
    DB_PASSWORD=db_pass_sample
